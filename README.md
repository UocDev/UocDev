I have been a software developer (Senior) since 2022, and a "tech geek" long long before that.
my interests include eat oreos, roblox gaming, hangout with friends. I discovered Discord in 2024 and some time later adopted the moniker "Uoc." The name was inspired by the staff members on Discord server FPE:S, and also this name has the meaning in Vietnamese: Expectations.
